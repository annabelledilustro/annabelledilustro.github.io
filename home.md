I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://linguistics.cornell.edu/current-graduate-students">Department of Linguistics</a> at Cornell University and a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/">Cornell Phonetics Lab (PLab)</a>. Before coming to Cornell, I completed BAs in English (Linguistics) and Asian Languages and Literatures (Japanese) at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://linguistics.chass.ncsu.edu/">NC State University</a>. 

My main research interests include phonetics, voice disguise, speaker recognition, speech kinematics, and speech perception.

When I'm not doing linguistics, you can likely find me (re)watching a horror movie, taking my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://annabelledilustro.github.io/folder/corny_walk.jpg" >cat</a> for a walk, or rock climbing.

I also work as a Presenting and Writing Tutor for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elso.as.cornell.edu/">English Language Support Office</a>.
