I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://linguistics.cornell.edu/current-graduate-students">Department of Linguistics</a> at Cornell University and a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/">Cornell Phonetics Lab (PLab)</a>. Before coming to Cornell, I completed BAs in English (Linguistics) and Asian Languages and Literatures (Japanese) at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://linguistics.chass.ncsu.edu/">NC State University</a>. 

My main research interests include phonetics, voice disguise, speaker recognition, speech kinematics, and speech perception. 
I'm particularly interested in how talkers can modify identifiable facets of their speech such as pitch, phonation quality, and timing characteristics to disguise their identity. My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://annabelledilustro.github.io/research/">current research</a> looks specifically at whisper as a method of voice disguise, with its lack of F0 and different lengthing/shortening effects possibly distorting certain talker-specific attributes.

When I'm not doing linguistics, you can likely find me watching a horror movie, taking my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://annabelledilustro.github.io/folder/corny_walk.jpg" >cat</a> for a walk, or rock climbing.
