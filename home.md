I am a third-year Ph.D student in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://linguistics.cornell.edu/current-graduate-students">Department of Linguistics</a> at Cornell University. I am a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/">Cornell Phonetics Lab (PLab)</a>. Before coming to Cornell, I completed BAs in English (Linguistics) and Asian Languages and Literatures (Japanese) at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://linguistics.chass.ncsu.edu/">NC State University</a>. 

<b>Research interests:</b> phonetics, sociolinguistics, voice disguise, and speaker recognition

When I'm not doing linguistics, you can likely find me reading books about vampire folklore, taking my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://annabelledilustro.github.io/folder/corny_walk.jpg" >cat</a> for a walk, rock climbing, or falling down rabbit holes about game design.
